    delivery for Apple Platforms. Done in collaboration with <a
        href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-mobile-team-llc/" target="_blank">The Mobile Team</a>.
    For this effort we refactored the existing Mac client code base into a universal application that would also run on
    iOS as well as setting up a CI/CD system to deliver application releases integrating existing tooling and workflows
    the <a href="https://jointoucan.com" target="_blank">Toucan</a> team had already setup.
