Hello and welcome to my node on the web. My name is **Jeff Trespalacios**, and I am a software engineer currently based in [Los Angeles, CA](https://maps.apple.com/?address=Los+Angeles,+CA). I excel at using technology to create solutions to people's problems in many forms including:

- iOS Application Development
- Backend Web Services
- Automating Business Functions
- Setting up Continuous Integration/Deployment Systems

![This is me][1]

I enjoy working on Apple platforms and the web. I am well versed in Swift, Typescript/Javascript and SQL. In addition to those I am also comfortable with Objective-C, Ruby, PHP, and C# and am more than capable of picking up other technologies on the fly. Check out some of the places I've worked and the things I've done [on my resume](/resume).
